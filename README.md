# Data Structures

This project contains various implementations of data structures in Python alongside tests to verify the correct implementation. Each data structure includes basic operations like insert, delete, search and traversal. Each data structure uses object-oriented programming principles for clean and modular code. 

## Data Structures
- Simple complexity
  1. Stacks
  2. Queue
  3. Deques
- Moderate complexity
  1. Singly linked lists
  2. Doubly linked lists
- High complexity
  1. Hash tables
  2. Binary trees
  3. Balanced binary trees (BST)
  4. Heaps (Min and Max-heaps)
  5. Graphs

## Requirements
`Pytest` to run the tests.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-structures.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder
```zsh
cd data-structures
```

3. Create and activate the virtual environment
```zsh
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate #On mac and linux
myenv/Scripts/activate #On Windows
```

4. Install dependencies 
```zsh
pip install .
```

## Running tests

To execute all the tests, first, make sure that you have pytest installed. Then run the test suite to verify the correct implementation of all data structures. 

## Contributing

Feel free to mention anything that can be improved or that you think could be added to any of the data structures.
